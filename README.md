# BossCatBot
This is a twitter bot that searches for tweets containing the words "my boss" and replaces them with "my cat." This bot is built on Google Apps Script Engine and uses airhadoken's TwitterLib at https://github.com/airhadoken/twitter-lib and his script template from https://botwiki.org/bot-workshops/botmaking-from-the-ground-up/.

To use, open this script in https://script.google.com and then add TwitterLib library from https://github.com/airhadoken/twitter-lib by going to Resources -> Libraries in the script menu dropdown and searching for MKvHYYdYA4G5JJHj7hxIcoh8V4oX7X1M_ (the script id).
