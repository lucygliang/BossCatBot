# BossCatBot
This is a twitter bot that searches for tweets containing the words "my boss" and replaces them with "my cat." This bot is built on Google Apps Script Engine and uses TwitterLib. I created this using API-Based Google script template from https://botwiki.org/bot-workshops/botmaking-from-the-ground-up/ and airhadoken's Twitter library for Google Apps Script: https://github.com/airhadoken/twitter-lib.

To run, open this script in https://script.google.com and then add TwitterLib from https://github.com/airhadoken/twitter-lib by going to Resources -> Libraries in the script menu dropdown and searching for MKvHYYdYA4G5JJHj7hxIcoh8V4oX7X1M_ (the script id).
